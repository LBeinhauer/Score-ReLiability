<p>Heterogeneity in standardised effect sizes, such as Cohen’s d, is informative because it is often interpreted as evidence that a phenomenon varies across contexts or populations. In research synthesis, one influential explanation for such variation is that it arises from differences in measurement precision across studies, implying that correcting effect sizes for attenuation due to score unreliability should reduce between-study variability. We reanalyse data on a wide range of phenomena from large-scale collaborative projects, including the ManyLabs studies, Registered Replication Reports, and the Psychological Science Accelerator. We apply conventional attenuation correction procedures and propose an alternative framework that treats standardised effect sizes as ratio variables to examine how differences in score reliability relate to heterogeneity. Across datasets, differences in score reliability are small and can not explain effect size heterogeneity, contrary to prevailing expectations. For most phenomena, attenuation correction procedures increased heterogeneity, rather than decreasing it. We attribute this to between-study differences in underlying score distributions that dominate the comparatively small variation in random measurement error. These findings imply that unreliability is unlikely to be a major driver of effect size heterogeneity for phenomena comparable to the ones reanalysed here. More broadly, the results suggest that meta-analysts should not expect that effect size heterogeneity can be reduced or explained by controlling for differences in random measurement error. Our results call for greater attention to substantive sources of heterogeneity, such as sampling practices or population differences, when synthesising empirical research and interpreting heterogeneity in meta-analytic models across studies and disciplines.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Large-scale collaborative replication efforts have sparked discussions surrounding the replicability of psychological phenomena. For attempts to estimate a phenomenon’s replicability or to predict whether a future replication will replicate successfully, heterogeneity is a crucial parameter that needs to be assessed<span class="citation" data-cites="stanley2018"><sup><a href="#ref-stanley2018" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span>. In the meta-analytic context, heterogeneity describes the variation of effect sizes, free of sampling error<span class="citation" data-cites="dersimonian1986 higgins2002 riley2011"><sup><a href="#ref-dersimonian1986" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>–<a href="#ref-riley2011" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span>. Therefore, the presence of heterogeneity can imply that some replications of a single phenomenon may be successful, while others are not. If heterogeneity increases, meaning the phenomenon’s effect size varies more strongly for unexplained reasons, the probability of observing an effect size around zero or even in the negative space grows larger as well<span class="citation" data-cites="kenny2019"><sup><a href="#ref-kenny2019" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span>. If we know the mean size and heterogeneity of a phenomenon’s effect, we would theoretically be able to establish an expected replication rate<span class="citation" data-cites="vu2024"><sup><a href="#ref-vu2024" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, it has been argued that heterogeneity in effect sizes is an indicator of the theory’s “completeness” surrounding the phenomenon. For example, Linden and Hönekopp argue that “low (as opposed to high) heterogeneity reflects a more advanced understanding of the subject matter being studied”<span class="citation" data-cites="LindenHönekopp"><sup><a href="#ref-LindenHönekopp" role="doc-biblioref">7(p2)</a></sup></span>. Similarly, von Hippel and Schuetze<span class="citation" data-cites="vonHippel2023"><sup><a href="#ref-vonHippel2023" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span> argue that heterogeneity in effects is an indicator of a vague, poorly specified theory.</p>
<p>Large-scale attempts of direct replications, using identical protocols, such as the Many Labs studies or Registered Replication Reports (e.g.<span class="citation" data-cites="ManyLabs1 RRRHart"><sup><a href="#ref-ManyLabs1" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>,<a href="#ref-RRRHart" role="doc-biblioref">10</a></sup></span>) for the first time allow researchers to estimate heterogeneity undistorted by selection processes like publication bias. In re-analyses of these studies, Olsson-Collentine et al.<span class="citation" data-cites="olsson2020"><sup><a href="#ref-olsson2020" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span> identify a positive correlation between a phenomenon’s effect size and its heterogeneity. Both van Erp et al.<span class="citation" data-cites="vanErp2017"><sup><a href="#ref-vanErp2017" role="doc-biblioref">12</a></sup></span> and Stanley et al.<span class="citation" data-cites="stanley2018"><sup><a href="#ref-stanley2018" role="doc-biblioref">1</a></sup></span> estimate strong degrees of heterogeneity across conceptual replications in Psychology. In a separate re-analysis of large scale direct replications, Renkewitz et al.&nbsp;(in preparation) identify substantial heterogeneity in almost all projects where a non-zero effect could be identified. This aligns with the correlation found by Olsson-Collentine et al.<span class="citation" data-cites="olsson2020"><sup><a href="#ref-olsson2020" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>The search for moderators that might explain said heterogeneity across several phenomena has not been particularly successful<span class="citation" data-cites="ManyLabs3"><sup><a href="#ref-ManyLabs2" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span>. Another source for this heterogeneity, which is not a typical moderator tied to a specific theory, might be impairments in score reliability which vary in their extent across replications<span class="citation" data-cites="olsson2020"><sup><a href="#ref-olsson2020" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span>. Hunter and Schmidt<span class="citation" data-cites="hunter2004"><sup><a href="#ref-hunter2004" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span> and Wiernik and Dahlke<span class="citation" data-cites="wiernik2020"><sup><a href="#ref-wiernik2020" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></sup></span>, discussing the role of score reliability for standardised effect sizes, claim that differences in score reliability should inflate, and therefore increase, heterogeneity. This implies that standard corrections for imperfect score reliability, such as attenuation correction procedures, should remove that inflation, reducing heterogeneity in corrected effect sizes.</p>
<p>Over the following pages, we assess whether score reliability can in fact be made responsible for heterogeneity identified across several psychological phenomena. However, we find no empirical evidence for the argument that correcting for differences in score reliability reduces effect size heterogeneity. Instead, we find that heterogeneity might as well be larger after the correction procedure. Therefore, previous analyses and assumptions regarding the relationship between score reliability and heterogeneity need to be false. In the second half of this text we make use of analytical arguments to identify the necessary conditions under which an attenuation correction inevitably leads to an increase in effect size heterogeneity.</p>

<section id="effect-sizes-and-score-reliability-in-meta-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="effect-sizes-and-score-reliability-in-meta-analysis">Effect sizes and score reliability in meta-analysis</h2>
<p>In both the initial reports of large scale replication attempts, as well as the re-analyses by Olsson-Collentine et al.<span class="citation" data-cites="olsson2020"><sup><a href="#ref-olsson2020" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span>, standardised effect sizes (from here-on abbreviated as ES) such as Cohen’s d or Hedge’s g were used. For the remainder of the article, Cohen’s d, defined in <a href="#eq-d" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;1</a>, will be used as an exemplary estimate of ES, as it is used across a wide range of contexts and well understood by a broad audience.</p>
<p><span id="eq-d"><span class="math display">\[d = \frac{MD}{\sigma_X} \tag{1}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Here, MD refers to the mean difference between two groups of interest, while <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X\)</span> is the pooled standard deviation. As is widely known, score reliability affects ES (e.g.<span class="citation" data-cites="hunter2004 wiernik2020"><sup><a href="#ref-hunter2004" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>,<a href="#ref-wiernik2020" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></sup></span>). In the context of classical test theory (CTT) score reliability <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{XX’}\)</span> is defined as the ratio of true to total score variance<span class="citation" data-cites="lord2008"><sup><a href="#ref-lord2008" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></sup></span>, as defined in <a href="#eq-rel" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;2</a>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-rel"><span class="math display">\[\rho_{XX’} = \frac{\sigma^2_T}{\sigma^2_X}=\frac{\sigma^2_T}{\sigma^2_T + \sigma^2_E} \tag{2}\]</span></span></p>
<p>In this equation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_T^2\)</span> refers to the true score variance in the sense of CTT, meaning the actual variance of the variable, undistorted by random measurement error. In the same sense, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X^2\)</span> refers to the total variance of scores, including both the true variance and the random error variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_E^2\)</span>. This implies that, if true score variance is assumed to be constant across replications, a lower score reliability can only occur due to a larger error score variance. Total score variance would also be larger, therein leading to a smaller ES, as opposed to a similar data-set where a higher score reliability is achieved through a smaller error score variance. However, score reliability is an aspect of a measuring instrument applied to a population<span class="citation" data-cites="lord2008 vacha1998"><sup><a href="#ref-lord2008" role="doc-biblioref">17</a>,<a href="#ref-vacha1998" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></sup></span>. In the meta-analytic context, as studies tend to be replicated in a variety of populations, neither true nor error score variance can be expected to always be identical across replications. This most likely leads to heterogeneity in score reliability, which, as discussed, is bound to affect ES heterogeneity as well.</p>
<p>Previous discussions of heterogeneity in score reliability have exclusively discussed it as a parameter that inflates heterogeneity in ES, implying that, if score reliability was perfect across all replications, the actual heterogeneity would have been lower. In their discussion, Wiernik and Dahlke claim that „<em>Measurement error variance will impact the results of meta-analyses in three ways: by (a) biasing the mean effect size toward zero, (b) inflating effect-size heterogeneity and confounding moderator effects, and (c) confounding publication-bias and sensitivity analyses</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="wiernik2020"><sup><a href="#ref-wiernik2020" role="doc-biblioref">16(p3)</a></sup></span>. Additionally, more clearly, they state that “<em>If the studies included in a meta-analysis differ in their measures’ reliabilities, heterogeneity estimates will be artifactually inflated, erroneously suggesting larger potential moderator effects</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="wiernik2020"><sup><a href="#ref-wiernik2020" role="doc-biblioref">16(p4)</a></sup></span>. They base their claims largely on work done by Hunter and Schmidt<span class="citation" data-cites="hunter2004"><sup><a href="#ref-hunter2004" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span>, who claim that “<em>Variation in reliability across studies causes variation in the observed effect sizes above and beyond that produced by sampling error.</em>” (p.&nbsp;302). Overall, both references imply that differences in score reliability inevitably lead to an inflated heterogeneity in ES.</p>
<p>As both sources Hunter and Schmidt<span class="citation" data-cites="hunter2004"><sup><a href="#ref-hunter2004" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span> and Wiernik and Dahlke<span class="citation" data-cites="wiernik2020"><sup><a href="#ref-wiernik2020" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></sup></span> will be referred to repeatedly, we abbreviate these references as H&amp;S and W&amp;D respectively.</p>
<section id="attenuation-correction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="attenuation-correction">Attenuation correction</h3>
<p>If information concerning score reliability is available, it is possible to correct the individual ES for its unreliability. This process is also known as attenuation correction and, while not without its criticisms<span class="citation" data-cites="muchinsky1996 schmidt1996 schennach2016"><sup><a href="#ref-muchinsky1996" role="doc-biblioref">19</a>–<a href="#ref-schennach2016" role="doc-biblioref">21</a></sup></span>, is a repeatedly recommended practice in Psychology<span class="citation" data-cites="hunter2004 wiernik2020"><sup><a href="#ref-hunter2004" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>,<a href="#ref-wiernik2020" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></sup></span>. <a href="#eq-dc" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;3</a> describes a simple attenuation correction procedure.</p>
<p><span id="eq-dc"><span class="math display">\[d_c = \frac{d}{\sqrt{\hat{\rho}_{xx’}}} \tag{3}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(d_c\)</span> describes the attenuation-corrected estimate of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, which is corrected by dividing it by the estimate of score reliability <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\rho}_{xx’}\)</span>. As described in W&amp;D or Lord &amp; Novick<span class="citation" data-cites="lord2008"><sup><a href="#ref-lord2008" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></sup></span>, this is essentially the same, as if the corrected estimate of <span class="math inline">\(d_c\)</span> was constructed using an estimate of true score standard deviation, as in <a href="#eq-dct" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;4</a>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-dct"><span class="math display">\[d_c = \frac{MD}{\hat{\sigma}_{T}}=\frac{MD}{\sqrt{\hat{\rho}_{xx’} \hat{\sigma}_X^2}} \tag{4}\]</span></span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\hat{\sigma}_T\)</span> can be estimated by simply rearranging the terms from <a href="#eq-rel" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;2</a>. Thereby, an estimate of ES is generated, under the premise that score reliability would have been perfect (<span class="math inline">\(\rho_{xx'} = 1\)</span>).</p>
<p>The claims made in W&amp;D imply that corrections of individual observed ESs for their unreliability should lead to lower estimates of heterogeneity in meta-analyses of corrected ES. If heterogeneity in score reliability adds to ES heterogeneity, attenuation correction procedures should eliminate that additional variation, as all corrected ES come with identical (perfect) score reliability.</p>
<p>Re-analyses of the collaborative multi-site replication efforts have uncovered differences in score reliability across replications of the same phenomena<span class="citation" data-cites="shaw2020"><sup><a href="#ref-shaw2020" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></sup></span>. The claims made in W&amp;D and H&amp;S imply that the ES heterogeneity uncovered in these projects therefore could potentially be explained by these differences in score reliability. Similarly, in a re-analysis of multi-site replication projects, Olsson-Collention et al.<span class="citation" data-cites="olsson2020"><sup><a href="#ref-olsson2020" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span> discuss differences in score reliability as a potential moderator for ES heterogeneity.</p>
<p>Therefore, we assess the extent to which this intuition is supported by empirical evidence in the following section. The re-analysis of archival data serves to shed light on the following research question:</p>
<ul>
<li>To what extent can heterogeneity in standardised effect sizes be reduced by means of an attenuation correction?</li>

<p>We have collected a large number of openly available multi-site direct replications on psychological phenomena<span class="citation" data-cites="dripht2024"><sup><a href="#ref-dripht2024" role="doc-biblioref">23</a></sup></span>. The data-sets of about 55 phenomena, largely stemming from the efforts of the Many Labs studies, Registered Replication Reports or the Psychological Science Accelerator, are made openly available in a standardised format at <a href="https://osf.io/7p8rk/" class="uri">osf.io/7p8rk/</a>, the DRIPHT repository. A documentation of the standardised format, including a web-application to easily explore the public data-sets, can be found in Fünderich et al.<span class="citation" data-cites="fuenderich_metapipex2024"><sup><a href="#ref-fuenderich_metapipex2024" role="doc-biblioref">24</a></sup></span>.</p>
<section id="data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data">Data</h3>
<p>The ManyLabs projects were collaborative efforts to replicate several psychological phenomena across different research sites, employing identical protocols. From five published projects, the data for the first three and the fifth Many Labs projects<span class="citation" data-cites="ManyLabs1 ManyLabs2 ManyLabs3 ManyLabs5"><sup><a href="#ref-ManyLabs1" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>,<a href="#ref-ManyLabs3" role="doc-biblioref">13</a>,<a href="#ref-ManyLabs2" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>,<a href="#ref-ManyLabs5" role="doc-biblioref">25</a></sup></span> were harmonized and publicly stored in a standardised format when the DRIPHT repository was set up<span class="citation" data-cites="dripht2024"><sup><a href="#ref-dripht2024" role="doc-biblioref">23</a></sup></span>. The Registered Replication Reports are similar collaborative efforts, with the sole distinction that for each report a single phenomenon was replicated several times. The Registered Reports 3-10 were added to the DRIPHT repository, as they employed experimental designs with at least two groups<span class="citation" data-cites="RRRHart RRRSripada RRRFinkel RRRStrack RRRRand RRRDijksterhuis RRRSrull RRRMazar"><sup><a href="#ref-RRRHart" role="doc-biblioref">10</a>,<a href="#ref-RRRSripada" role="doc-biblioref">26</a>–<a href="#ref-RRRMazar" role="doc-biblioref">32</a></sup></span>. Lastly, some projects from the Psychological Science Accelerator were added to the DRIPHT repository, namely PSA006, PSACR001, PSACR002 and PSACR003<span class="citation" data-cites="PSA006 PSACR001 PSACR002 PSACR003"><sup><a href="#ref-PSA006" role="doc-biblioref">33</a>–<a href="#ref-PSACR003" role="doc-biblioref">36</a></sup></span>. In contrast to Many Labs or Registered Replication Projects, these collaborative efforts, while also distributed across the globe, do not formally attempt to perform direct replications. Instead, these projects focus on original research or conceptual research done collaboratively in laboratories across the globe. However, as each project used the same protocol and participants are distributed across different countries, a data structure similar to that of a multi-site replication study emerges. What makes all these collaborative efforts valuable for this manuscript is the fact that all phenomena collected in the DRIPHT-repository are making use of two-group designs and are therefore easily assessed using standardised mean differences.</p>
<p>While replication data on a decent number of psychological phenomena is available in the DRIPHT-repository, selected phenomena need to fulfil three conditions to demonstrate how incorporating score reliability affects heterogeneity in ES: (1) As we focus on the use of ES <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, the phenomenon needs to be assessed using a group design consisting of at least two groups. (2) Score reliability estimates can be derived, this implies that the phenomenon needs to be measured using either several indicators forming a single scale or by repeatedly measuring across several timepoints. (3) Score reliability can only attenuate effect sizes that are not zero in the first place. Therefore, we focus on phenomena where meta-analytic mean ES can be statistically distinguished from zero. This aligns with the observation made in (Renkewitz, Fünderich &amp; Beinhauer, in preparation) and Olsson-Collentine et al.<span class="citation" data-cites="olsson2020"><sup><a href="#ref-olsson2020" role="doc-biblioref">11</a></sup></span>. As null-effects displayed little to no heterogeneity, there is no variability that might be reduced by incorporating differences in score reliability. While the first criterion is fulfilled by all phenomena found in the DRIPHT repository, the second and third criteria still need evaluation.</p>
<p>As all phenomena in the collection fulfil the first condition, 50 phenomena have been catalogued where the effect is studied by comparing the outcome across two separate groups. From the collection of 50 phenomena, 21 fulfil the second condition, so that estimates of score reliability can be derived. For the 21 phenomena, the dependent variable used to construct the effect size is measured by employing more than a single indicator. The number of indicators per scale varied between 3 and 30. The majority of scales was made up of 3 to 6 items. At the same time, however, this implies that the remaining 29 phenomena did not make use of more than a single indicator to measure the dependent variable. Therefore, for the majority of phenomena it is not possible to assess whether measurement quality is sufficiently high in terms of internal consistency or low random error variance.</p>
<p>From the 21 phenomena that employed more than a single indicator, 19 made use of Likert-style items, where respondents would indicate their agreement to some kind of statement. The scale-length varied from 3 to 10-points. The items measuring the remaining 2 phenomena were coded dichotomously, as responses were right or wrong. While the majority of designs make use of some form of control-treatment manipulation, randomly assigning participants to a condition (19 phenomena), some phenomena refer to the effect of pre-existing differences, e.g. biological sex (2 phenomena). Subsequently, those phenomena need to be identified where the meta-analytic mean effect size is statistically significant different from zero. This will be done as a preliminary step in this manuscript’s analysis procedure. Detailed information concerning the different phenomena and how they were measured can be found at [https://osf.io/g2fzq], while a brief summary can be found in appendix C.</p>
<p>To assess whether ES heterogeneity can be reduced by correcting for score reliability, estimates of meta-analytic heterogeneity are compared across two situations: first, heterogeneity of raw ES, as computed in <a href="#eq-d" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;1</a> is assessed. Secondly, ES are corrected for imperfect reliability. Computing the heterogeneity of these corrected ES allows for an assessment, whether the heterogeneity did indeed shrink compared to the first situation, as predicted in W&amp;D and H&amp;S.</p>
<p>In order to derive estimates of meta-analytic heterogeneity, we make use of a random-effects meta-analysis. Broken down, a random-effects meta-analysis essentially pools the sampling uncertainty of the different estimates that are to be aggregated. By removing this pooled estimate from the observed variability in the effect size estimates, we can generate an estimate of its heterogeneity - how strongly the effect sizes vary beyond their pooled sampling uncertainty.</p>
<p>For the standardised mean difference <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, we can compute the standard error as an estimate of its sampling uncertainty. The standard error of Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is computed as defined in <a href="#eq-SEd" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;5</a>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-SEd"><span class="math display">\[SE_d=\sqrt{\frac{n_1+n_2}{n_1n_2}+\frac{d^2}{2\left(n_1+n_2\right)}} \tag{5}\]</span></span></p>
<p>As the corrected estimate of Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is larger and requires an additional unknown parameter, an estimate of score reliability, the larger uncertainty in this parameter should be reflected in a larger standard error. The standard error for <span class="math inline">\(d_c\)</span> is defined in <a href="#eq-SEdc" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;6</a>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-SEdc"><span class="math display">\[SE_{d_c} = \sqrt{SE^2_d \frac{d_c}{d}} \tag{6}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The estimates concerning the meta-analytic mean and heterogeneity of these standardised effect sizes attempt to describe their population distribution. Therefore, over the following paragraphs, whenever we refer to estimates derived by means of random effects meta-analysis, we will use the Greek letter <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> to denote estimates of uncorrected <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>’s population distribution and <span class="math inline">\(\delta_c\)</span> to denote estimates of corrected <span class="math inline">\(d_c\)</span>’s population distribution.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>For each replication of a phenomenon, Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is computed as an estimate of raw ES, according to <a href="#eq-d" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;1</a>, including its standard error (<a href="#eq-SEd" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;5</a>). Subsequently, a random-effects meta-analysis is performed using metafor version 4.8-0<span class="citation" data-cites="metafor"><sup><a href="#ref-metafor" role="doc-biblioref">37</a></sup></span>. To estimate meta-analytic mean ES and heterogeneity we make use of the REML-estimator, as that estimator tends to perform best across a range of conditions<span class="citation" data-cites="hoenekopp2022"><sup><a href="#ref-hoenekopp2022" role="doc-biblioref">38</a></sup></span>. To identify which phenomena pass criterion (3) we use a Wald-type significance test, assessing for which phenomenon the meta-analytic mean ES is significantly different from zero. For this hypothesis test, as all other hypothesis tests in this manuscript, we employ a one-tailed significance level of .05.</p>
<p>Additionally, estimates of score reliability are derived. While not without criticism<span class="citation" data-cites="sijtsma2009"><sup><a href="#ref-sijtsma2009" role="doc-biblioref">39</a></sup></span>, Cronbach’s Alpha is used to estimate score reliability. It is often noted that tau-equivalence is an unrealistic assumption to hold against real-world data, implying that other estimates of score reliability, such as McDonald’s Omega<span class="citation" data-cites="mcdonald1999"><sup><a href="#ref-mcdonald1999" role="doc-biblioref">40</a></sup></span>, Guttman’s Lambda 2 or 4<span class="citation" data-cites="guttman1945"><sup><a href="#ref-guttman1945" role="doc-biblioref">41</a></sup></span>, or the Greatest Lower Bound<span class="citation" data-cites="tenBerge2004"><sup><a href="#ref-tenBerge2004" role="doc-biblioref">42</a></sup></span> might be better suited. However, all scales employed in this project are scored by computing the simple mean or sum of responses across items for each individual. Computing the mean or sum of several items implicitly assumes tau-equivalence, as each item contributes equally to the individual’s test score. Therefore, Cronbach’s Alpha is the better choice to estimate score reliability, as it avoids a mismatch in assumptions between how the score is computed and how score reliability is estimated. The individual estimates of Cohen’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> are corrected using estimates of Cronbach’s Alpha, according to <a href="#eq-dc" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;3</a>, including the corrected standard errors (<a href="#eq-SEdc" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;6</a>). Thereby, estimates of ES are computed, which are corrected for imperfect reliability. Again, a random-effects meta-analysis is run using metafor, generating an estimate of heterogeneity in corrected ES. Different indicators of heterogeneity are readily available, such as <span class="math inline">\(I^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H^2\)</span><span class="citation" data-cites="borenstein2009 higgins2002"><sup><a href="#ref-higgins2002" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>,<a href="#ref-borenstein2009" role="doc-biblioref">43</a></sup></span>. A relative heterogeneity measure less common in Psychology, but easily computed is the coefficient of variation <span class="math inline">\(CV = \frac{\tau}{\mu}\)</span>. However, the descriptions found in H&amp;S and W&amp;D discuss the absolute amount of heterogeneity in terms of variance (<span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\)</span>) or standard deviation (<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>). Therefore, we also make use of absolute heterogeneity here.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in order to assess whether ES heterogeneity was indeed reduced by the attenuation correction procedure, the estimates of heterogeneity in uncorrected ES and corrected ES are compared. Using Cochran’s <em>Q</em>-test<span class="citation" data-cites="cochran1954"><sup><a href="#ref-cochran1954" role="doc-biblioref">44</a></sup></span>, we assess whether the estimates of heterogeneity are statistically significantly different from 0. Only for those projects where we have sufficient confidence that the individual estimates of heterogeneity are larger than zero can we actually begin to interpret whether there was any change.</p>
<p>To identify whether a reduction in ES heterogeneity is indeed accompanied by differences in score reliability, the estimates of score reliability are assessed meta-analytically as well. To do so, a Reliability Generalization Meta-Analysis is performed<span class="citation" data-cites="vacha1998 sanchez2013"><sup><a href="#ref-vacha1998" role="doc-biblioref">18</a>,<a href="#ref-sanchez2013" role="doc-biblioref">45</a></sup></span>. This entails that individual estimates of score reliability are adequately transformed using Bonett’s transformation:</p>
<p><span id="eq-Bonett"><span class="math display">\[T_{\hat{\rho}} = ln(1 - \hat{\rho}) \tag{7}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The transformation in <a href="#eq-Bonett" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;7</a> has variance-stabilising properties and therefore allows for adequate inferences concerning heterogeneity in score reliability<span class="citation" data-cites="bonett2002"><sup><a href="#ref-bonett2002" role="doc-biblioref">46</a></sup></span>. Cochran’s Q-test is used to identify statistically significant heterogeneity in transformed score reliability. Estimates derived from a Reliability Generalization Meta-Analysis using these transformations can be back-transformed to the original score reliability scale<span class="citation" data-cites="beinhauer2025"><sup><a href="#ref-beinhauer2025" role="doc-biblioref">47</a></sup></span>:</p>
<p><span id="eq-rel_back_mu"><span class="math display">\[\mu_{\rho{xx'}} \approx 1 - exp(\mu_{T\left[\rho_{XX^\prime}\right]})-\frac{1}{2} exp(\mu_{T\left[\rho_{xx'}\right]})\tau_{T\left[\rho_{XX^\prime}\right]}^2 \tag{8}\]</span></span></p>
<p>In <a href="#eq-rel_back_mu" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;8</a>, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{\rho_{XX'}}\)</span> is the back-transformed meta-analytic mean score reliability - on the original coefficient’s scale between 0 and 1. Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{\mu_{\rho_{XX'}}}\)</span> is the back-transformed heterogeneity in score reliability:</p>
<p><span id="eq-rel_back_tau"><span class="math display">\[\tau_{\rho_{xx'}}^2 \approx exp(\mu_{T\left[\rho_{xx'}\right]})2 \tau_{T\left[\rho_{xx'}\right]}^2+exp(\mu_{T\left[\rho_{xx'}\right]})^2\tau_{T\left[\rho_{xx'}\right]}^4 \tag{9}\]</span></span></p>
<p>We executed these steps for each phenomenon. The statistical programming language R, Version 4.4.2<span class="citation" data-cites="RCore"><sup><a href="#ref-RCore" role="doc-biblioref">48</a></sup></span> is used for all data manipulation and statistical analysis. Graphics are constructed using the R package <em>ggplot2</em>, version 3.5.1<span class="citation" data-cites="ggplot2"><sup><a href="#ref-ggplot2" role="doc-biblioref">49</a></sup></span>.</p>

Generally, this leads to larger (absolute) ES and larger standard errors after the correction. As an example from the 21 selected phenomena, the results from this procedure on replications of Nosek’s study on sex differences in preferences for the subject of Arts is displayed in the forest plot in <a href="#fig-forest" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>. Here, grey dots represent the uncorrected ES for each sample, while black dots represent the corrected ES in each sample. The bars surrounding these dots show the respective 95%-CIs.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Grey dots represent uncorrected estimates of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, while black dots represent corrected estimates of <span class="math inline">\(d_c\)</span>. Similarly, grey bars visualise the 95%-CI for uncorrected estimates, black bars the 95%-CIs for corrected estimates. The grey diamond represents the meta-analytic estimate of uncorrected ES <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{d}\)</span>, its width represents the 95%-CI of said estimate. The black diamond represents the same parameters for the meta-analytic estimate of corrected ES <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{d_c}\)</span>,.</p>
<p>In <a href="#fig-forest" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a> it becomes apparent that the reliability attenuation procedure leads to an increase in the individual absolute effect size, as the black dots are moved further from zero. Simultaneously, the standard errors grew larger after the attenuation correction, which leads to larger 95%-CIs. This is most easily observed for the MTurk-sample, which had a rather large confidence interval to begin with. Additionally, in the diamond at the bottom of the figure, we can see that the meta-analytic mean ES is also larger after the attenuation correction took place. <a href="#tbl-meanES" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a> contains estimates and test results for all phenomena, both corrected and uncorrected.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="which-phenomena-pass-criterion-3">Which phenomena pass criterion (3)?</h4>
<p><a href="#tbl-meanES" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a> demonstrates that what we observed in <a href="#fig-forest" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a> holds across all 21 phenomena. All meta-analytic effects are larger in their absolute size after applying an attenuation correction procedure. Similarly, the uncertainty quantified in the estimate’s standard error is larger. Additionally, <a href="#tbl-meanES" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a> highlights which phenomena pass criterion (3)—the effect size must be statistically significantly distinguishable from zero at <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .05\)</span>. Twelve phenomena pass this criterion. It may be remarked that the attenuation correction procedure, in this data, appears to have no influence on whether a phenomenon passes the criterion. The differences in p-value are rather small and lead to no difference in conclusion, regarding a significance level of 5%.</p>

<p><a href="#tbl-tauES" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a> contains the results from performing an RG-MA on the Cronbach’s Alpha coefficients of the scales used to measure the 12 remaining phenomena. Additionally, it contains estimates of heterogeneity for both uncorrected ES (<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>) and corrected ES (<span class="math inline">\(d_c\)</span>), which are central to assess the research question posed in section <em>Attenuation Correction</em>. Most importantly, <a href="#tbl-tauES" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a> demonstrates that for all but one of the phenomena, the attenuation correction procedure barely has an impact on the extent of ES heterogeneity. However, while the heterogeneity for the phenomenon from RRR9 (Behaviour) seems to be reduced by about a third of its initial value, the ES heterogeneity for this phenomenon is rather small to begin with. Using a significance test, we can not distinguish this value confidently from zero. This implies that for none of phenomena, differences in score reliability can be made responsible for heterogeneity in standardised effect sizes.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mu}_{\rho_{XX'}}\)</span> is the back-transformed meta-analytic estimate of mean score reliability; <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_{\rho_{XX'}}\)</span> is the back-transformed estimate of heterogeneity in score reliability; <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_{d}\)</span> represents the estimate of heterogeneity in uncorrected <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_{d_c}\)</span> represents the estimate of the heterogeneity in corrected <span class="math inline">\(d_c\)</span>.</p>
<p>Secondly, in <a href="#tbl-tauES" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a> we find that for ten out of twelve phenomena, ES heterogeneity grows as a result from the attenuation correction procedure. However, it needs to be noted that these differences are rather small. For this reason, we do not mean to interpret these differences, while we note that the direction of differences are clearly inconsistent with expectations formulated in the literature discussed so far. These results are incompatible with claims made in W&amp;D and H&amp;S.</p>
<p>Generally, however, it is noteworthy that removing differences in score reliability only had a very little impact on ES heterogeneity. It appears that, across the phenomena assessed in this project, the heterogeneity before and after the correction procedure barely changes. At least for the projects re-analysed here, differences in score reliability do not affect ES heterogeneity as strongly as assumed.</p>
<p>Concerning the remaining two phenomena, for the phenomenon described in ML5 - Shnabel (RPP), the reduction in heterogeneity is miniscule and the estimate of heterogeneity is not statistically significant in the first place. Most likely, the difference in ES heterogeneity estimates can be explained by issues of estimation, as only eight replications are available. Similarly, only for the phenomenon described in RRR9 (Behaviour), we find a seemingly substantial reduction in heterogeneity due to the attenuation correction procedure. The estimates of ES heterogeneity are not statistically significant, however, which hampers our ability to meaningfully interpret and compare these estimates. For the majority of phenomena it appears that differences in score reliability do not inflate heterogeneity in uncorrected effect sizes. Instead these differences mask ES heterogeneity that can be unveiled by accounting for score reliability.</p>

<section id="relationship-between-score-reliability-and-effect-size-heterogeneity" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relationship-between-score-reliability-and-effect-size-heterogeneity">Relationship between score reliability and effect size heterogeneity</h2>
<p>In the re-analysis of archival data in the previous section we demonstrated that, at least for the multi-site direct replication and PSA-projects, score reliability does not hold any noteworthy value as a potential moderator explaining ES heterogeneity. Additionally, we demonstrated that claims formulated in W&amp;D and H&amp;S regarding how score reliability heterogeneity increases ES heterogeneity are false. We found a large number of phenomena where, contrary to popular claims, correcting for score reliability increases ES heterogeneity, instead of decreasing it.</p>
<p>This implies that there is an error in the reasoning or intuition behind claims made in H&amp;S and W&amp;D, as our observations can not be explained by the current literature. Over the following paragraphs, we will briefly explore the intuition that might have led to the previous claims. Subsequently, we will use analytical arguments to clarify how score reliability actually affects ES heterogeneity. Therein, we also identify potential conditions under which an attenuation correction will actually increase ES heterogeneity - and under which it is more likely to decrease it.</p>
<section id="intuitive-relationship" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intuitive-relationship">Intuitive relationship</h3>
<p>It might help to think about linear models, when discussing the intuitive idea that controlling for score reliability should reduce ES heterogeneity. Heterogeneity describes unexplained variation in a parameter’s true distribution, that we model using meta-analytic techniques<span class="citation" data-cites="borenstein2009 higgins2002"><sup><a href="#ref-higgins2002" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>,<a href="#ref-borenstein2009" role="doc-biblioref">43</a></sup></span>. In that way, the idea of heterogeneity is closely related to residual variance, as we observe it in a simple linear model. Both describe variation that could not be explained by the model specifications, be it a model that employs predictive variables like a simple linear model or a meta-analytic model incorporating uncertainty in terms of standard errors.</p>
<p>The residual variance that remains in a simple linear model is reduced in all instances, where we use a predictor that we know shares variance with the predicted parameter. Generally, removing a source of variance by controlling for it, we expect any unexplained variation to shrink. Similarly, we know that differences in score reliability, by definition, are related to differences in standardised effect sizes. Therefore, intuitively, it seems sensible to expect that controlling for differences in score reliability should reduce the unexplained variance in standardised effect sizes, as described in H&amp;S and W&amp;D.</p>
<p>Hunter &amp; Schmidt have additionally derived an equation which demonstrates how heterogeneity in score reliability affects heterogeneity in ESs<span class="citation" data-cites="hunter2004"><sup><a href="#ref-hunter2004" role="doc-biblioref">15(p309)</a></sup></span>. <a href="#eq-HS" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;10</a> implies that heterogeneity in <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is essentially a function in which heterogeneity and mean value of <span class="math inline">\(\delta_c\)</span> are weighted by mean score reliability <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{xx‘}\)</span> and its heterogeneity. Here, we adjusted the notation from Hunter &amp; Schmidt<span class="citation" data-cites="hunter2004"><sup><a href="#ref-hunter2004" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span> to the notation used through this text.</p>
<p><span id="eq-HS"><span class="math display">\[\tau^2_{\delta} = [\mu_{\rho_{xx‘}}]^2 \tau^2_{\delta_c} + [\mu_{\delta_c}]^2 \tau^2_{\rho_{xx‘}} \tag{10}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> refers to the uncorrected ES, undistorted by sampling error but not corrected for measuring error. With the index <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\delta_c\)</span>, on the other hand, refers to the corrected ES, undistorted by sampling error and measurement error. Lastly, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{XX'}\)</span> refers to score reliability. Hunter &amp; Schmidt<span class="citation" data-cites="hunter2004"><sup><a href="#ref-hunter2004" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span> claim that <a href="#eq-HS" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;10</a> demonstrates that differences in score reliability inflate ES heterogeneity, which means that an attenuation correction procedure would have to reduce ES heterogeneity. However, it can be easily verified that <a href="#eq-HS" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;10</a> does not allow for such claims. Depending on both the mean value <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{\rho_{xx‘}}\)</span> and the heterogeneity <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2_{\rho_{xx‘}}\)</span> in score reliability, ES heterogeneity might be increased or decreased by the differences in score reliability.</p>
<p>Most likely, Hunter and Schmidt did not fully explore the implications of <a href="#eq-HS" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;10</a>, but followed the general intuition we lined out – “If a source of variation is controlled for, the amount of unexplained variance should be reduced.” Wiernik and Dahlke<span class="citation" data-cites="wiernik2020"><sup><a href="#ref-wiernik2020" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></sup></span> refer to the work by Hunter &amp; Schmidt<span class="citation" data-cites="hunter2004"><sup><a href="#ref-hunter2004" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span>, likely following their intuition.</p>
<p>In the re-analysis of archival data, we have demonstrated that this intuition does not hold for the relationship of ES heterogeneity and score reliability. Instead, we propose an alternative way that helps us discern under which conditions we can expect an attenuation correction procedure to lead to an increase in ES heterogeneity.</p>

<section id="describing-es-as-a-random-ratio-variable" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="describing-es-as-a-random-ratio-variable">Describing ES as a random ratio variable</h3>
<p>Realising that an ES, as defined in <a href="#eq-d" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;1</a>, is actually a ratio, allows for an analytical description alternative to <a href="#eq-HS" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;10</a> of how differences in score reliability can affect ES heterogeneity. If the phenomenon is heterogeneous and score reliability varies across replications, it seems sensible to assume that both numerator and denominator (MD and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X\)</span>) from <a href="#eq-d" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;1</a> vary across replications. In that case, the ES can be described as a random variable stemming from a ratio distribution. A ratio distribution is a probability distribution constructed by dividing one random variable by a second random variable: <span class="math inline">\(Z = \frac{X}{Y}\)</span>. First order Taylor approximation may be used to generate estimates of mean and variance of the ratio variable<span class="citation" data-cites="vanKempen1999"><sup><a href="#ref-vanKempen1999" role="doc-biblioref">50</a></sup></span>. Taylor approximations typically require no specific assumptions regarding the distribution form, but that the variable (here a ratio) is a) differentiable, b) has existing moments and that c) its higher-order moments are negligible<span class="citation" data-cites="vandervaart2000"><sup><a href="#ref-vandervaart2000" role="doc-biblioref">51</a></sup></span>. Here we use the Taylor-estimator of the ratio’s variance to demonstrate how differences in score reliability may affect heterogeneity in ES.</p>
<p><span id="eq-XYZ_cov"><span class="math display">\[\tau^2[Z] \approx \frac{\tau^2[X]}{\mu[Y]^2} - \frac{2\mu[X]}{\mu[Y]^3} cov[X,Y] + \frac{\mu[X]^2}{\mu[Y]^4} \tau^2[Y] \tag{11}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Assuming that the random variables are uncorrelated, simplifies the equation to</p>
<p><span id="eq-XYZ"><span class="math display">\[\tau^2[Z] \approx \frac{\tau^2[X]}{\mu[Y]^2} + \frac{\mu[X]^2}{\mu[Y]^4} \tau^2[Y] \tag{12}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Substituting for ES, unstandardised mean difference MD and pooled standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X\)</span> leads to</p>
<p><span id="eq-ratio_d0"><span class="math display">\[\tau^2[\delta] \approx \frac{\tau^2[MD]}{\mu[\sigma_x]^2} + \frac{\mu[MD]^2}{\mu[\sigma_x]^4} \tau^2[\sigma_x] \tag{13}\]</span></span></p>
<p>As stated in <a href="#eq-dct" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;4</a>, correcting ES for score reliability can be described through a correction of the pooled standard deviation: <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_T = \sqrt{\rho_{xx’} \sigma^2_x}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{xx'}\)</span> is always between zero and one, in the case of imperfect score reliability, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_T\)</span> will always be smaller than total <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_x\)</span>.</p>
<p>In <a href="#eq-rel" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;2</a> we see that total standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X\)</span> is constructed only from error score variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_E^2\)</span> and true score variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_T^2\)</span>. Measurement precision should generally only affect the error score variance. Therefore, if the heterogeneity in <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X\)</span> was introduced purely by differences in measurement precision, an attenuation correction procedure can remove that heterogeneity. Alternatively, the underlying latent variable may not be distributed identically across replications. In that case, true score variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_T\)</span> would vary across replications and induce heterogeneity in <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X\)</span>. This heterogeneity would lead to differences in standardised differences ES as well, but it can not be removed by means of an attenuation correction procedure.</p>
<p>In that case, some heterogeneity in <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_T\)</span> would remain, albeit heterogeneity found in <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X\)</span> was reduced. <a href="#eq-ratio_d0" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;13</a> essentially demonstrates how mean and heterogeneity of MD, paired with mean and heterogeneity of total score standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X\)</span> can be used to estimate heterogeneity in raw ES <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>. Similarly, we can adjust <a href="#eq-ratio_d0" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;13</a> to describe how, instead of total score standard deviation, mean and variance in true score standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_T\)</span> affect heterogeneity in corrected ES <span class="math inline">\(\delta_c\)</span>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-ratio_d"><span class="math display">\[\tau^2[\delta_c] \approx \frac{\tau^2[MD]}{\mu[\sigma_T]^2} + \frac{\mu[MD]^2}{\mu[\sigma_T]^4} \tau^2[\sigma_T] \tag{14}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The differences between the two <a href="#eq-ratio_d0" class="quarto-xref">Equations&nbsp;13</a> and <a href="#eq-ratio_d" class="quarto-xref">14</a> demonstrate how ES heterogeneity is affected by an attenuation correction procedure. According to the quotes in H&amp;S and W&amp;D, <a href="#eq-ratio_d0" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;13</a> should lead to a larger value of <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\left[\delta\right]\)</span>, compared to the estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2\left[\delta_c\right]\)</span> from <a href="#eq-ratio_d" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;14</a>. However, as demonstrated in the re-analysis of archival data, we can already expect that this can not be an implication of these Equations.</p>
<p>Instead, what is guaranteed is that the expected value of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_T\)</span> is smaller than or equal to the expected value of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X\)</span>. Similarly, the heterogeneity in <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_T\)</span> is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to the uncorrected heterogeneity in <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X\)</span>. However, since the expected value of either standard deviation is placed in the denominator of the function and the variance of either is placed in the numerator of the function, <a href="#eq-HS" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;10</a> is not sufficient to explain how heterogeneity in ES changes due to the attenuation correction.</p>
<p>In this section, we attempt to understand under which circumstances the heterogeneity in ES grows larger as the result of an attenuation correction procedure, contrary to claims made in W&amp;D and H&amp;S. To do so, we propose the following inequality, involving <a href="#eq-ratio_d0" class="quarto-xref">Equations&nbsp;13</a> and <a href="#eq-ratio_d" class="quarto-xref">14</a>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-ineq_init"><span class="math display">\[\tau^2_{\delta_c} &gt; \tau^2_{\delta} \quad  \quad \quad \quad \quad  \frac{\tau_{MD}^2}{\mu_{\sigma_T}^2} + \frac{\mu_{MD}^2}{\mu_{\sigma_T}^4} \tau^2_{\sigma_T} &gt; \frac{\tau_{MD}^2}{\mu_{\sigma_x}^2} + \frac{\mu_{MD}^2}{\mu_{\sigma_x}^4} \tau^2_{\sigma_x} \tag{15}\]</span></span></p>
<p>As long as the inequality defined in <a href="#eq-ineq_init" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;15</a> holds true, an attenuation correction procedure would lead to larger estimates of ES heterogeneity. Conditions under which <a href="#eq-ineq_init" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;15</a> does not hold are conditions under which the claims made in W&amp;D and H&amp;S are met. Unfortunately, the inequality in this form does not convey sufficient information about the conditions under which it can potentially hold. In Appendix A, we rearranged <a href="#eq-ineq_init" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;15</a>, so we end up with a form that we can use to actually derive conditions under which ES heterogeneity can be inflated or deflated by differences in score reliability.</p>
<p>To do so, we had to introduce two additional metrics.</p>
<p><span id="eq-R1"><span class="math display">\[R_1 = \frac{\mu_{\sigma^2_T}}{\mu_{\sigma^2_X}} \tag{16}\]</span></span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> describes the relative size of mean true score variance, compared to the mean observed score variance. This informs us, how much of the mean total score variance can be attributed to mean true score variance. Therefore, this metric is close to the average score reliability. Large values indicate that correcting the individual score variances (or standard deviations for that matter) using the attenuation correction procedure should lead to very little change in ES, as most of the variation observed were due to genuine differences in true scores. Small values indicate the opposite, the observed score variance was due to a larger amount of random error score variance, leading to a stronger correction. The metric <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> on the other hand describes in how far the attenuation correction procedure has successfully reduced heterogeneity in score variance <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2_{\sigma^2_X}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-R2"><span class="math display">\[R_2 = \frac{\tau^2_{\sigma^2_T}}{\tau^2_{\sigma^2_X}} \tag{17}\]</span></span></p>
<p>A value of 1 indicates that the heterogeneity in true score variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_T\)</span> is exactly as large as the heterogeneity initially observed. Smaller values indicate how much heterogeneity is “left”, after applying an attenuation correction, relative to the initial heterogeneity. This means that a value of .7 indicates that about 70% of heterogeneity in score variance remains, even after correcting for differences in score reliability. As only 30% of score variance heterogeneity could be removed, this would imply that differences in error score variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_E\)</span> were responsible for less than a third of the heterogeneity in score variances found. On the contrary, more than two thirds of heterogeneity could be attributed to actual differences in how the underlying true scores are distributed across samples.</p>
<p>Concerning the re-arranged inequality from Appendix A, we identify one sufficient but not necessary condition or rule described in <a href="#eq-ineq_short" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;18</a>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-ineq_short"><span class="math display">\[R_1^3 \leq R_2 \tag{18}\]</span></span></p>
<p>With sufficient but not necessary we mean that, as long as <a href="#eq-ineq_short" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;18</a> holds, an attenuation correction will inevitably increase ES heterogeneity. However, if the inequality does not hold, it is not guaranteed that the attenuation correction can decrease ES heterogeneity. Whether ES heterogeneity can be decreased depends on additional parameters, that we left out of this short form, but can be found, accompanied by a more detailed description, in <a href="#eq-ineq_fin" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;26</a>, Appendix A.</p>
<p>As long as <span class="math inline">\(R_1^3\)</span> is smaller or equal compared to <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>, <a href="#eq-ineq_init" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;15</a> is bound to hold true. This means that as long as the average score reliability, to the power of 3, does not exceed the relative remaining variance heterogeneity after the attenuation correction, <a href="#eq-ineq_init" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;15</a> is not violated. For example, assuming average score reliability is about .8, the heterogeneity in <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_T\)</span> needs to make up less than 51.2% (<span class="math inline">\(R_2 \geq .8^3 = .512\)</span>) of the heterogeneity in total score variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_X\)</span>. At <span class="math inline">\(R_1 = .8\)</span>, as long as <span class="math inline">\(R_2 \geq .512\)</span>, the claims made in W&amp;D and H&amp;S can not hold.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> essentially describes the relative size of mean score variance after the attenuation correction, and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> essentially describes the relative size of score variance heterogeneity after the attenuation correction. Therefore, <a href="#eq-ineq_short" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;18</a> states the following regarding the change in mean value and heterogeneity due to the correction: ES heterogeneity will always be increased, as long as the remaining proportion of heterogeneity in score variance is not substantially smaller than the remaining proportion of its mean value.</p>
<p>As long as there are substantial differences in the true score variance across administrations, it is unlikely that an attenuation correction can actually produce such a low <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>. Generally speaking, <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> largely depends on the relative measurement precision. If measurements were made more precisely, average score reliability and <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> would be higher. On the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> depends on how different the measurement precision was at the individual administrations, but also how different the individual administrations sites are regarding their true score variance.</p>
<p>In our example of <span class="math inline">\(R_1 = .8\)</span>, the true score variance is 4 times as large as the error score variance. However, for the attenuation correction to reduce ES heterogeneity, the smaller error score variance would need to account for almost 50 % of heterogeneity in score variance. This asymmetry grows even larger, as the average score reliability grows larger. This demonstrates that the individual size of either mean score variance component or its heterogeneity is not of importance. Instead, the ratio of these components determine whether heterogeneity can decrease after an attenuation correction.</p>
<p>It is important to reiterate that the condition in <a href="#eq-ineq_short" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;18</a> only describes under which conditions the inequality is guaranteed to hold, no matter what value other parameters like the mean value of <span class="math inline">\(MD\)</span> or its heterogeneity assume. This means that, if the condition in <a href="#eq-ineq_short" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;18</a> is violated, it is by no means guaranteed that an attenuation correction procedure would actually reduce heterogeneity in ES. Thereby, inference made from <a href="#eq-ineq_short" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;18</a> is asymmetrical. While we know, if the inequality holds, heterogeneity in corrected ES will be larger than heterogeneity in uncorrected ES, we can’t be certain that the opposite is true if the inequality does not hold.</p>

<p><a href="#tbl-tauES" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a> showed that for all phenomena, for which we identified statistically significant ES heterogeneity, the heterogeneity was even larger after the attenuation correction procedure. Here, we will re-analyse the data, estimating <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> for each phenomenon respectively. Therein, we not only show that our claims derived from analytical arguments hold up in empirical assessment, but also demonstrate how the metrics <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> help understand how score reliability affected ES heterogeneity in practice.</p>
<section id="sec-methods2" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-methods2">Methods</h4>
<p>Estimation of <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> requires estimates of meta-analytic mean and heterogeneity of both the total score variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_X\)</span> and the true score variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_T\)</span>. Elsewhere, we proposed the method Boot-Err<span class="citation" data-cites="beinhauer2025"><sup><a href="#ref-beinhauer2025" role="doc-biblioref">47</a></sup></span> as an alternative method to test for and estimate the differences in error score variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_E\)</span>. Among other things, in Beinhauer et al.<span class="citation" data-cites="beinhauer2025"><sup><a href="#ref-beinhauer2025" role="doc-biblioref">47</a></sup></span> we deliver detailed instructions on how estimates for mean and heterogeneity of total score variance, and the score variance components can be derived. This means that Boot-Err can be used to generate all estimates required for computation of the metrics <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>As Boot-Err makes use of meta-analytic techniques and bootstrap sampling, we perform analyses using the packages <em>metafor</em>, version 4.8-0<span class="citation" data-cites="metafor"><sup><a href="#ref-metafor" role="doc-biblioref">37</a></sup></span>, and <em>boot</em>, version 1.3-31<span class="citation" data-cites="boot"><sup><a href="#ref-boot" role="doc-biblioref">52</a></sup></span>, in the statistical programming language <em>R</em>, version 4.4.2<span class="citation" data-cites="RCore"><sup><a href="#ref-RCore" role="doc-biblioref">48</a></sup></span>.</p>

<section id="results-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="results-1">Results</h4>
<p><a href="#tbl-R1R2" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;3</a> reports the meta-analytic estimates of observed and true score variances, including their heterogeneity and metrics <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> across all 12 phenomena. We see that for ten out of 12 phenomena, the <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> metric is larger than the <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> metric. Additionally, we observe that across eight phenomena, <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> is larger than .96. This implies that of the heterogeneity observed in score variances, 97% or more could not be explained by differences in random error introduced by the measuring instrument, but by genuine differences in the underlying distribution.</p>
<p>For the two exceptions in <a href="#tbl-tauES" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a>, those phenomena where the attenuation correction procedure actually led to a decrease in ES heterogeneity (RRR9 (Behaviour) and ML5 - Shnabel (RPP)), we find that <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> is larger than <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span>. This clearly contradicts our interpretation of <a href="#eq-ineq_init" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;15</a>. As long as <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> is larger than <span class="math inline">\(R_1^3\)</span>, we expect a correction procedure to increase effect size heterogeneity. However, we recommend caution when interpreting both the change and the direction of said change for these two projects. The significance test for the ES heterogeneity was not significant, both before and after the correction. Since either the heterogeneity was so small or the sample size so low that the heterogeneity could not be statistically distinguished from zero, most likely, the reduction in heterogeneity is better explained by imprecise estimation than an actual reduction of heterogeneity.</p>
<p>Lastly, for two out of the 12 phenomena, ML5 - Albarracin and ML5 - Shnabel (Rev), we find <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{\sigma^2_X}\)</span> of 0. Therefore, the <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> metric could not be computed, as the denominator would have been zero. However, we also did not identify statistically significant heterogeneity in score reliability across replications, nor ES heterogeneity. The phenomena were assessed with a particularly low number of replications (9 and 8 respectively). Estimation precision for heterogeneity in variance components, even more so than for ES, largely depends on the sample size. Two alternative explanations for this observation are available: either, there is no heterogeneity in score variances across replications. In that case, there is also no heterogeneity that could be broken down into true and error score variance heterogeneity. Alternatively, the low sample size led to implausible estimates in both true and total score variance heterogeneity and subsequently to an implausible estimate of <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>. Meta-analytic estimates, especially those concerning score variance components such as <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>, should generally be interpreted with caution if the sample size was particularly low.</p>
<p>Generally, <a href="#tbl-R1R2" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;3</a> implies that for none of the measurements concerning these phenomena, the heterogeneity in observed score variances could be substantially explained by differences in measurement quality. For all phenomena, <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> was larger than <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span>, implying that an attenuation correction procedure could not reduce ES heterogeneity in any of these cases. The results in <a href="#tbl-tauES" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a> agree with this conclusion, as no phenomena could be identified where statistically significant ES heterogeneity was accompanied by a reduction in differences due to the correction.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>We have examined meta-analytic heterogeneity in standardised mean differences. Since score reliability is often discussed as a source for such heterogeneity, we estimated the heterogeneity before and after correcting for differences in reliability coefficients using an attenuation correction procedure. While we initially observed heterogeneity in score reliability across almost all measuring scales, the extent of this heterogeneity was very small across all scales. This initial finding already implies that differences in score reliability can only have a tiny impact on ES heterogeneity, if any.</p>
<p>This implication fits our subsequent results, as we found that a) in the majority of cases, the change in ES heterogeneity is small to non-existent. Across the data-sets we got to examine, differences in score reliability do not serve as an appropriate explanation for ES heterogeneity. We also found that b) in the majority of cases, the direction of change in ES heterogeneity did not align with assumptions formulated in W&amp;D and H&amp;S. In almost all cases (every single case, if we restrict ourselves to phenomena where we found statistically significant differences in ES), the attenuation correction led to increased estimates of ES heterogeneity. This means that the claims found in W&amp;D and H&amp;S, implying that an attenuation correction will reduce ES heterogeneity, stem from a misunderstanding of how score reliability can affect ESs.</p>
<p>Using analytical arguments, we derived a broad rule, outlining under which conditions we can expect an attenuation correction to increase ES heterogeneity. In general, score reliability affects ESs by inflating the score variance, as the (square root of the) score variance is used to standardize the mean difference. The conditions we found depend on how both the mean value and the heterogeneity of score variance are reduced by correcting for imperfect score reliability. We introduced two novel metrics: <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span>, describing the fraction of mean true score variance in the mean total score variance, therefore mirroring the average score reliability coefficient, and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>, describing the fraction of true score variance heterogeneity in the total score variance heterogeneity. We find that, as long as <span class="math inline">\(R_1^3 \leq R_2\)</span>, an attenuation correction will increase ES heterogeneity.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> is carrying the exponent of 3, it implies that the reduction in mean score variance is affecting the ES heterogeneity more strongly than the reduction in score variance heterogeneity. This is best described through an example: We know what an acceptable average score reliability looks like in the area of Psychology. Researchers largely target a score reliability of at least .7, preferably .8. An average score reliability of .7 implies that 70% of the variance observed in scores can actually be attributed to true underlying differences. From our derived rule, we know that, as long as <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> is larger or equal to <span class="math inline">\(.7^3 = .343\)</span>, the attenuation correction procedure can only increase ES heterogeneity. If we want to explain ES heterogeneity through score reliability, even though only 30% of the variance observed in score can be attributed to random measurement error, at least 65.7%, almost two thirds, of the heterogeneity in score variance would need to be attributable to differences in the error score variance. In other words, at most 34.3% of heterogeneity in score variances may be due to actual differences in how the latent variable is distributed (in terms of spread) across the administration sites. This disparity grows even larger, the higher the average score reliability is.</p>
<p>In the majority of studies done in the social and behavioural sciences<span class="citation" data-cites="hultsch2002 bornstein2013 ashraf2017 sears1986 zhao2021"><sup><a href="#ref-hultsch2002" role="doc-biblioref">53</a>–<a href="#ref-zhao2021" role="doc-biblioref">57</a></sup></span>, no proper sampling techniques beyond convenience sampling are employed. Most samples re-analysed throughout this text were collected by means of convenience sampling, where students self-select into studies. Without a valid sampling scheme, we essentially have no basis to assume anything about the true score variance<span class="citation" data-cites="hultsch2002"><sup><a href="#ref-hultsch2002" role="doc-biblioref">53</a></sup></span>. Most importantly, however, we have no reason to assume that the true score variance is homogeneous or stable across administration sites. Instead, it is very likely that the convenience sampling procedures produce samples that vary extremely strongly in how they are put together, leading to large degrees of true score variance heterogeneity. At the same time, score reliability is a low-hanging fruit to optimise as most researchers are aware and trained in assessing score reliability<span class="citation" data-cites="hussey2025"><sup><a href="#ref-hussey2025" role="doc-biblioref">58</a></sup></span>.</p>
<p>The combination of these aspects can explain what we observed throughout this text: Reliability coefficients are in an acceptable range, leading to a small, but constant reduction in mean score variance if we apply an attenuation correction. At the same time, there is substantial variation in true score variance, implying that most of the score variance heterogeneity can not be attributed to differences in error score variance. Since only differences in error score variance can be corrected for, the attenuation correction has a very small effect on heterogeneity estimates in score variance. Therefore, an attenuation correction is likely to have very little impact on ES heterogeneity. If anything, it most likely increases it. This also means that, in such settings, score reliability does not serve as a moderator explaining ES heterogeneity.</p>
<p>Our results fit in well with recent work by Olsson-Collentine et al.<span class="citation" data-cites="olsson2023"><sup><a href="#ref-olsson2023" role="doc-biblioref">59</a></sup></span>. In a large simulation scheme, they demonstrate that differences in score reliability across administrations typically deflate heterogeneity in uncorrected correlations. In such cases, an attenuation correction would increase correlation coefficient heterogeneity, as we observe for standardised mean differences. Only as the true heterogeneity in correlations grows larger would the correction procedure reduce heterogeneity as implied in W&amp;D. While correlations and standardised effect sizes are not identical, the way score (un)reliability affects these parameters is highly similar.</p>
<section id="limitations-constraints-on-generalizability" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations-constraints-on-generalizability">Limitations &amp; constraints on generalizability</h3>
<p>The empirical arguments presented are based on a rather small number of non-representative data-sets. Based on the combination of analytical and empirical arguments, we are convinced that differences in score reliability across replications in the current state of Psychology and the behavioural sciences, do not serve as appropriate explanations of ES heterogeneity. However, whether these results actually generalize beyond these data-sets remains to be seen. Unfortunately, the behavioural sciences are in dire need of open-data that resemble multi-site replications. As the majority of results discussed over the last years (in e.g.&nbsp;ManyLabs or Registered Replication Reports) employ single-indicator scales as dependent measures, score reliability can not be easily estimated in order to replicate our analyses.</p>
<p>The analytical arguments presented here, represented by <a href="#eq-ineq_fin" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;26</a> in <em>Appendix A</em>, hold as far as the use of the delta method does not lead to widely erroneous results. In <em>Appendix C</em>, we compare estimates derived from the delta-method and Boot-Err to assess in how far the delta-method leads to biased estimates. Across all but one data-set, differences were miniscule, leading us to believe that its use here was defensible. Only for the PSACR002-data-set, we identify larger differences. While we believe that <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> were estimated sufficiently well, <a href="#eq-ineq_fin" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;26</a> does not necessarily hold for how score reliability heterogeneity affected ES heterogeneity for that particular study.</p>
<p>Similarly, all equations following <a href="#eq-XYZ_cov" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;11</a> rest on the assumption that mean difference (<span class="math inline">\(MD\)</span>) and true or total score variance (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_X\)</span>) are independent. While this assumption is in line with assumptions underlying CTT, it is by no means guaranteed that it holds in these data-sets. If this assumption was violated, the impact of an attenuation correction procedure on ES heterogeneity would likely be affected. Whether this could lead to larger or lower ES heterogeneity after the procedure than we currently assume depends on whether the covariance in <a href="#eq-XYZ_cov" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;11</a> is positive or negative. However, generally we have no reason to assume that there is a systematic relationship between mean difference and standard deviation. As this relationship would also affect the distribution of ES like Cohen’s d itself, strong violations of this assumption would go far beyond invalidating the claims we derived in <a href="#eq-ineq_short" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;18</a>. Most likely, assumptions of the tests concerning the meta-analytic mean ES and the presence of ES heterogeneity would be violated, making any research on change in ES heterogeneity due to attenuation correction obsolete.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Heterogeneity in ES, even in direct replications where experimental factors are held as constant as possible, is substantial (Renkewitz et al., in preparation). However, we have demonstrated that in several scenarios, differences in score reliability did not serve as appropriate moderators or explanations of ES heterogeneity. Contrary to popular expectations, correction for differences in score reliability did not reduce ES heterogeneity. Instead, ES heterogeneity was increased, albeit to a very small degree. Generally, concerning the multi-site replication projects or collaborative research projects, accounting for differences in score reliability did not help us gain a better understanding of the phenomena.</p>
<section id="where-to-go-from-here" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here</h3>
<p>We have demonstrated that, even though differences in measurement precision are present across most phenomena we could re-analyse, these are strongly outweighed by the differences in true score variance. However, what a true score variance actually means strongly depends on how that number came to be. A sample that is very diverse in its composition likely comes with a large true score variance. On the other hand, a sample that is highly homogeneous in its composition comes with a smaller true score variance. Importantly, the same is not true for random measurement error. Error variance should always be the same size, if the errors are truly random, no matter how the sample is put together. Unfortunately, most phenomena we re-analysed here came to be through means of convenience sampling. Therefore, it is not clear what the large differences in true score variance actually imply - are they expressions of genuine differences between the populations, or just expressions of different self-selection procedures across the samples? As the variance observed in a convenience sample is not representative to some <em>specified</em> population, we simply can not know.</p>
<p>Issues of generalizability due to the lack of sampling techniques have been, and are still, repeatedly called out for the same reasons. Our findings therein reiterate these calls. We believe that we should focus our data collection efforts on the generation of samples, where we know that the variance in a sample is actually meaningful. This is most easily achieved by proper sampling techniques, which ensure that the sample is representative for some specified population. In such cases, it might be that the true score variance varies less strongly than what we currently observe. And should the heterogeneity in true score variance remain as large, than we know that this is crucial information from which we can draw meaningful inferences. We could learn more about standardised effect sizes and why our phenomena vary across settings, populations or continents. We strongly believe that the valuable resources invested into research output could be put towards more informative use than what seems to be the status quo by ensuring that the variances observed in different samples are representative for specified populations.</p>
<p>The work done by Hunter and Schmidt<span class="citation" data-cites="hunter2004"><sup><a href="#ref-hunter2004" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span> was crucial in informing and guiding methodology development in the field of meta-analyses. Similarly, Wiernik and Dahlke<span class="citation" data-cites="wiernik2020"><sup><a href="#ref-wiernik2020" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></sup></span> raise a number of important points that go far beyond attenuation correction and have been neglected in the application of meta-analytic research over the last decades. We generally agree with their ideas that underappreciated (differences in) reliability can introduce substantial biases in meta-analytic estimates and tests in Psychology. However, based on our findings, we believe that the issues created by ignoring random sampling are much more dire and warrant immediate attention. Only once we can be sure that the variance in true scores or latent factors is actually meaningful for some population, we can turn towards imprecise measurements, expecting correction procedures to explain unwarranted heterogeneity. In the current state of Psychology, meta-analysts should not expect that correcting ES for score reliability will actually explain heterogeneity identified.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a---rearranging-the-inequality">A - Rearranging the inequality</h3>
<p>Both metrics <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> make use of parameters of the distributions of true and total score variance, not standard deviations. This choice was made to facilitate the discussion of score reliability, as score reliability itself is defined by variances, not standard deviations (see <a href="#eq-rel" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;2</a>).</p>
<p>Using the metrics <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>, defined in <a href="#eq-R1" class="quarto-xref">Equations&nbsp;16</a> and <a href="#eq-R2" class="quarto-xref">17</a>, we attempt to understand under which circumstances the inequality defined in <a href="#eq-ineq_init" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;15</a> holds true. However, while the metrics make use of mean and heterogeneity of the score variances, <a href="#eq-ineq_init" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;15</a> makes use of mean and heterogeneity of the standard deviations. In order to incorporate the metrics, it is necessary to reparameterise the equation. Using the delta method to approximate mean value and heterogeneity of variance from those of the standard deviations, we know that<span class="citation" data-cites="casella2002"><sup><a href="#ref-casella2002" role="doc-biblioref">60</a></sup></span>: <span id="eq-delta_method"><span class="math display">\[\mu^2_{\sigma_X} \approx \mu_{\sigma^2_X} \quad \quad  and \quad \quad
\tau^2_{\sigma_X} \approx \frac{\tau^2_{\sigma_X^2}}{4\mu_{\sigma^2_X}} \tag{19}\]</span></span></p>
<p>While <a href="#eq-delta_method" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;19</a> only contains parameters for the observed score variance/standard deviation, the same can be done using the true score variance/standard deviation. Using the approximates defined in <a href="#eq-delta_method" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;19</a> for observed and true score variance, we arrive at a new inequality in <a href="#eq-ineq_CV" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;20</a>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-ineq_CV"><span class="math display">\[\frac{\tau_{MD}^2}{\mu_{\sigma^2_t}} + \frac{\mu_{MD}^2}{\mu^2_{\sigma_t^2}} \frac{\tau^2_{\sigma_t^2}}{4\mu_{\sigma^2_t}} &gt; \frac{\tau_{MD}^2}{\mu_{\sigma^2_x}} + \frac{\mu_{MD}^2}{\mu^2_{\sigma_x^2}} \frac{\tau^2_{\sigma_x^2}}{4\mu_{\sigma^2_x}} \tag{20}\]</span></span></p>
<p><a href="#eq-ineq_CV" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;20</a> describes that the heterogeneity in corrected ES is larger than the heterogeneity in uncorrected ES, using parameters of the distributions of mean difference MD, true score variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_T\)</span> and observed score variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_X\)</span>. By introducing the metrics <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> to this inequality, we can begin to disentangle which conditions need to be fulfilled for the inequality to hold. Rearranging the terms in <a href="#eq-R1" class="quarto-xref">Equations&nbsp;16</a> and <a href="#eq-R2" class="quarto-xref">17</a>, and subsequently entering these terms into <a href="#eq-ineq_CV" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;20</a> leads to the following <span id="eq-ineq_R"><span class="math display">\[\frac{\tau_{MD}^2}{R_1 \mu_{\sigma^2_x}} + \frac{\mu_{MD}^2}{R_1^2 \mu^2_{\sigma^2_x}} \frac{R_2 \tau^2_{\sigma_x^2}}{4 R_1 \mu_{\sigma^2_x}} &gt; \frac{\tau_{MD}^2}{\mu_{\sigma^2_x}} + \frac{\mu_{MD}^2}{\mu^2_{\sigma_x^2}} \frac{\tau^2_{\sigma_x^2}}{4\mu_{\sigma^2_x}} \tag{21}\]</span></span></p>
<p><a href="#eq-ineq_R" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;21</a>, again, describes the inequality that heterogeneity in corrected ES is larger than the heterogeneity in uncorrected ES, incorporating the metrics <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>. This equation alone is not sufficient to identify the relevant circumstances required for the inequality to hold. In a series of steps, we will rearrange <a href="#eq-ineq_R" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;21</a> to facilitate interpretation.</p>
<p>Firstly, for <a href="#eq-ineq_rearr1" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;22</a> we pulled all terms onto the left side of the inequality.</p>
<p><span id="eq-ineq_rearr1"><span class="math display">\[\frac{\tau_{MD}^2}{R_1 \mu_{\sigma^2_x}} - \frac{\tau_{MD}^2}{\mu_{\sigma^2_x}} + \frac{\mu_{MD}^2}{R_1^2 \mu^2_{\sigma^2_x}} \frac{R_2 \tau^2_{\sigma_x^2}}{4 R_1 \mu_{\sigma^2_x}} - \frac{\mu_{MD}^2}{\mu^2_{\sigma_x^2}} \frac{\tau^2_{\sigma_x^2}}{4\mu_{\sigma^2_x}} &gt;  0 \tag{22}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Secondly, as all terms contain <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{\sigma^2_x}\)</span> in the denominator, to arrive at <a href="#eq-ineq_rearr2" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;23</a> we multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{\sigma^2_x}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-ineq_rearr2"><span class="math display">\[\frac{\tau_{MD}^2}{R_1} - \tau_{MD}^2 + \frac{\mu_{MD}^2}{R_1^2 \mu^2_{\sigma^2_x}} \frac{R_2 \tau^2_{\sigma_x^2}}{4 R_1} - \frac{\mu_{MD}^2}{\mu^2_{\sigma_x^2}} \frac{\tau^2_{\sigma_x^2}}{4} &gt;  0 \tag{23}\]</span></span></p>
<p>For <a href="#eq-ineq_rearr3" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;24</a> we properly combined the multiplied fractions.</p>
<p><span id="eq-ineq_rearr3"><span class="math display">\[\frac{\tau_{MD}^2}{R_1} - \tau_{MD}^2 + \frac{\mu_{MD}^2 R_2 \tau^2_{\sigma_x^2}}{4R_1^3 \mu^2_{\sigma^2_x}} - \frac{\mu_{MD}^2\tau^2_{\sigma_x^2}}{4\mu^2_{\sigma_x^2}}  &gt;  0 \tag{24}\]</span></span></p>
<p>We define <span class="math inline">\(CV{\sigma^2_x}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(CV{\sigma^2_x} = \frac{\tau_{\sigma^2_x}}{\mu_{\sigma^2_x}}\)</span>, thereby allowing to simplify for <a href="#eq-ineq_rearr4" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;25</a>.</p>
<p><span id="eq-ineq_rearr4"><span class="math display">\[\frac{\tau_{MD}^2}{R_1} - \tau_{MD}^2 + \frac{\mu_{MD}^2 R_2}{4R_1^3}CV^2{\sigma^2_x} - \frac{\mu_{MD}^2}{4}CV^2{\sigma^2_x}  &gt;  0 \tag{25}\]</span></span></p>
<p>As a last step, factoring out finalizes rearranging the terms from <a href="#eq-ineq_R" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;21</a> to <a href="#eq-ineq_fin" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;26</a>:</p>
<p><span id="eq-ineq_fin"><span class="math display">\[ \tau_{MD}^2\left(\frac{1}{R_1} - 1\right) + \frac{\mu_{MD}^2 CV^2_{\sigma^2_X}}{4} \left(\frac{R_2}{R_1^3}  - 1\right) &gt; 0 \tag{26}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The circumstances under which the inequality described in <a href="#eq-ineq_fin" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;26</a> holds, are circumstances where the claims made in W&amp;D and H&amp;S are directly contradicted, as in those cases the ES heterogeneity is larger after applying an attenuation correction procedure. Concerning the terms in <a href="#eq-ineq_fin" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;26</a>, we know that all terms left-hand of the inequality, outside of the brackets (<span class="math inline">\(\tau^2_{MD}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mu^2_{MD}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(CV^2_{\sigma^2_X}\)</span>), are bound to be positive. For the inequality to hold, we need the left-hand side to remain positive, larger than zero. We can distil two scenarios, under which this equation should hold: (a) one of the terms inside the brackets (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{R_1} - 1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\frac{R_2}{R^3_1}  - 1\)</span>) is positive and large enough, so that the second term not containing that same bracket is positively dominated by the first term, meaning it is sufficiently large that the positive term cancels out the negative term; or (b) both terms inside the brackets need to be positive.</p>
<p>Generally, we know that both <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> are bound to be positive, as both contain different, strictly positive parameters of the distributions of true and observed score variance. Additionally, we know that <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> is equivalent to the average score reliability, and therefore bound between <span class="math inline">\(0\le R_1\le1\)</span>. Therefore, the term inside the first bracket is bound to be positive (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{R_1} – 1\)</span>). Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>, as the ratio of true and error score variance heterogeneity, is bound between <span class="math inline">\(0\le R_2\le1\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(R_1^3\)</span> is larger than <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>, then the term inside the second bracket turns negative. Generally, this means that the inequality can only be violated if the relative remaining heterogeneity of score variance (<span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>) is smaller than the average score reliability to the power of 3. Restated in mathematical terms, this leads us to the rule/condition described in <a href="#eq-ineq_short" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;18</a>, in the main text.</p>
<p>However, it is crucial to note that violation of <span class="math inline">\(R_1^3 \leq R_2\)</span> is just a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the inequality not to hold anymore. Should <span class="math inline">\(R_1^3 \leq R_2\)</span> not hold, the negative term in <a href="#eq-ineq_fin" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;26</a> still needs to be sufficiently large, that it can negatively dominate the positive term. That would mean that the combination of parameters <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{MD}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{MD}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(CV_{\sigma^2_x}\)</span> need to take on values, that allow for such a scenario. Since we do not want to make any claims regarding the unstandardised mean difference and how it relates to the coefficient of variation of score variance, we can not distil a scenario in which it is guaranteed, that <a href="#eq-ineq_fin" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;26</a> is violated. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(R_1^3 \leq R_2\)</span> only describes a condition, under which it is guaranteed that <a href="#eq-ineq_fin" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;26</a> holds. If <span class="math inline">\(R_1^3 \leq R_2\)</span> is violated, it is a first necessary condition for the entire inequality to be violated, but it is not sufficient as it still depends on other parameters.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b---examining-bias-due-to-delta-method">B - Examining bias due to delta-method</h3>
<p>The analytical arguments, detailed in <em>Appendix A</em>, leading to <a href="#eq-ineq_short" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;18</a>, rest on the use of the delta-method<span class="citation" data-cites="vandervaart2000 cramer1999 casella2002"><sup><a href="#ref-vandervaart2000" role="doc-biblioref">51</a>,<a href="#ref-casella2002" role="doc-biblioref">60</a>,<a href="#ref-cramer1999" role="doc-biblioref">61</a></sup></span>. <a href="#eq-ineq_init" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;15</a> contains parameters of distributions of the standard deviations of scores, while the <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> metrics were designed to discuss score variances. The delta-method rests on a number of assumptions, at least one of which is likely violated in our analysis: the variance of the variable to be transformed needs to be small<span class="citation" data-cites="cramer1999"><sup><a href="#ref-cramer1999" role="doc-biblioref">61</a></sup></span>. This entire procedure discusses the influence of variance in standard deviations on ES heterogeneity, introduced by differences in score reliability. Therefore, assuming that this assumption holds seems naive. Here, we explore the archival data, to understand in how far employing the delta-method on meta-analyses of standard deviations lead to results biased more strongly than estimates from the meta-analyses on score variances we performed using the Boot-Err technique.</p>
<p>We want to examine whether applying the delta-method sufficiently approximates the moments of the distribution of score variance to derive the conditions under which the inequality <a href="#eq-ineq_init" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;15</a> holds. To do so, we compared estimates of mean and heterogeneity of total score variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_X\)</span> derived using Boot-Err, and by running a meta-analysis on total score standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_x\)</span> and subsequently applying the delta-method to estimate mean and heterogeneity of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2_X\)</span> . Therein, we generated two sets of estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{\sigma^2_x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau^2_{\sigma^2_x}\)</span>, one via Boot-Err and one via the delta-method. If there are systematic differences between the sets, this points towards bias in the delta-method approximation. The estimates can be found in <a href="#tbl-delta" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;4</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mu}_{\sigma^2_X}\)</span> is the back-transformed meta-analytic estimate of mean total score variance, obtained via Boot-Err; <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_{\sigma^2_X}\)</span> is the back-transformed estimate of its heterogeneity. On the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mu}_{\Delta\sigma^2_X}\)</span> is the back-transformed meta-analytic estimate of mean total score variance, obtained from application of the delta method; <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\tau}_{\Delta\sigma^2_X}\)</span> is the back-transformed estimate of its heterogeneity.</p>
<p>Generally, for 11 out of 12 phenomena, we find miniscule but mostly negative differences between the two estimation strategies. This means that there is a slight downward bias in the estimates from the delta-method. However, for the majority of phenomena, the differences occur in the 2nd decimal, indicating that violations in the assumptions concerning the delta-method are negligible here. Only for the phenomenon described in PSACR002 (Behaviour) we find larger differences. These are large enough to be concerning and pertain largely the estimate of heterogeneity. Accordingly, inferences regarding this phenomenon need to be interpreted with caution. Generally, since for the majority of phenomena we find very little bias and as the delta-method is not used to generate estimates beyond this particular section, we believe its use to be defensible.</p>
