    abstract = { Heterogeneity emerges when multiple close or conceptual replications on the same subject produce results that vary more than expected from the sampling error. Here we argue that unexplained heterogeneity reflects a lack of coherence between the concepts applied and data observed and therefore a lack of understanding of the subject matter. Typical levels of heterogeneity thus offer a useful but neglected perspective on the levels of understanding achieved in psychological science. Focusing on continuous outcome variables, we surveyed heterogeneity in 150 meta-analyses from cognitive, organizational, and social psychology and 57 multiple close replications. Heterogeneity proved to be very high in meta-analyses, with powerful moderators being conspicuously absent. Population effects in the average meta-analysis vary from small to very large for reasons that are typically not understood. In contrast, heterogeneity was moderate in close replications. A newly identified relationship between heterogeneity and effect size allowed us to make predictions about expected heterogeneity levels. We discuss important implications for the formulation and evaluation of theories in psychology. On the basis of insights from the history and philosophy of science, we argue that the reduction of heterogeneity is important for progress in psychology and its practical applications, and we suggest changes to our collective research practice toward this end. }

  abstract  = "The study of moral judgements often centres on moral dilemmas in
               which options consistent with deontological perspectives (that
               is, emphasizing rules, individual rights and duties) are in
               conflict with options consistent with utilitarian judgements
               (that is, following the greater good based on consequences).
               Greene et al. (2009) showed that psychological and situational
               factors (for example, the intent of the agent or the presence of
               physical contact between the agent and the victim) can play an
               important role in moral dilemma judgements (for example, the
               trolley problem). Our knowledge is limited concerning both the
               universality of these effects outside the United States and the
               impact of culture on the situational and psychological factors
               affecting moral judgements. Thus, we empirically tested the
               universality of the effects of intent and personal force on
               moral dilemma judgements by replicating the experiments of
               Greene et al. in 45 countries from all inhabited continents. We
               found that personal force and its interaction with intention
               exert influence on moral judgements in the US and Western
               cultural clusters, replicating and expanding the original
               findings. Moreover, the personal force effect was present in all
               cultural clusters, suggesting it is culturally universal. The
               evidence for the cultural universality of the interaction effect
               was inconclusive in the Eastern and Southern cultural clusters
               (depending on exclusion criteria). We found no strong
               association between collectivism/individualism and moral dilemma
               judgements.",

abstract = {Communicating in ways that motivate engagement in social distancing remains a critical global public health priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study tested motivational qualities of messages about social distancing (those that promoted choice and agency vs. those that were forceful and shaming) in 25,718 people in 89 countries. The autonomy-supportive message decreased feelings of defying social distancing recommendations relative to the controlling message, and the controlling message increased controlled motivation, a less effective form of motivation, relative to no message. Message type did not impact intentions to socially distance, but people’s existing motivations were related to intentions. Findings were generalizable across a geographically diverse sample and may inform public health communication strategies in this and future global health emergencies. Finding communication strategies that effectively motivate social distancing continues to be a global public health priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-country, preregistered experiment (n = 25,718 from 89 countries) tested hypotheses concerning generalizable positive and negative outcomes of social distancing messages that promoted personal agency and reflective choices (i.e., an autonomy-supportive message) or were restrictive and shaming (i.e., a controlling message) compared with no message at all. Results partially supported experimental hypotheses in that the controlling message increased controlled motivation (a poorly internalized form of motivation relying on shame, guilt, and fear of social consequences) relative to no message. On the other hand, the autonomy-supportive message lowered feelings of defiance compared with the controlling message, but the controlling message did not differ from receiving no message at all. Unexpectedly, messages did not influence autonomous motivation (a highly internalized form of motivation relying on one’s core values) or behavioral intentions. Results supported hypothesized associations between people’s existing autonomous and controlled motivations and self-reported behavioral intentions to engage in social distancing. Controlled motivation was associated with more defiance and less long-term behavioral intention to engage in social distancing, whereas autonomous motivation was associated with less defiance and more short- and long-term intentions to social distance. Overall, this work highlights the potential harm of using shaming and pressuring language in public health communication, with implications for the current and future global health challenges.}}
